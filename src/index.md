I'm a senior researcher on the [PROSE team at Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/),
where we develop state-of-the-art program synthesis technologies to make software development
more accessible, productive, and fun. My current line of work focuses on
using neurosymbolic techniques for applications ranging from
program repair to programming by example, with a particular emphasis on the former.

I received a PhD in 
Computer Science (CS) from MIT under the supervision of Martin Rinard, an MS
in CS from NYU working with Dennis Shasha, and a BA in Economics from
University of Pennsylvania. I'm originally from Costa Rica.
