\section{Overview}
\small{
(As of \today{}) I'm a senior researcher in the PROSE team
at Microsoft, where I work on using machine learning to 
developed state-of-the-art
program synthesis systems to make writing, fixing, and using
software easier and more enjoyable. I have also worked
at Facebook, Cloudera, and (in prior life) Morgan Stanley.
