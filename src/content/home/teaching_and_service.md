I've had experience as a teaching assistant for programming languages
and grader for compiler construction.

- Teaching Assistant: Graduate Course in Programming Languages. Fall 2014, NYU
- Grader: Graduate Course in Compiler Construction. Spring 2015, NYU
- Grader: Graduate Course in Compiler Construction. Fall 2015, NYU
- Grader: Graduate Course in Compiler Construction. Spring 2016, NYU

I also like to be involved in activities around the student community
at MIT. Some examples of this are

- I co-organized, with Ivan Kuraj, the MIT Programming Languages Offsite 2017. The event is meant to foster dialogue and ideas amongst
members of the MIT PL community and neighboring institutions.
- I co-organized in 2017, with Candace Ross, the first diversity panel during admitted
students' visit weekend at MIT. The panel was meant to provide a location for
prospective students to ask any questions they might have about diversity at MIT and
how we are working towards improving our community.
- I am on the CSAIL Student Committee and serve as Treasurer (Fall 2017 - Current).
