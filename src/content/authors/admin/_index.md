I'm a fifth year Computer Science Ph.D.
student at MIT, advised by Martin Rinard.

My research interests are focused on the
intersection of software engineering and machine learning. I'm particularly
interested in learning from code corpora and from existing search procedures.

Recently, I've spent most of my time on two projects: AutoML
that exploits information found in code corpora, and applying ML to
Electronic Health Records for early prediction of pancreatic cancer
(jointly with physicians at BIDMC).

The results of my thesis research so far are presented in:

* [using dynamic program analysis for automated machine learning (AutoML)](publication/oopsla-2019/oopsla2019)
* [generating AutoML search spaces using API docs and code corpora](publication/fse-2020/fse2020)


I have also researched and published work on:

* [optimizing database queries to perform dynamic imputation](publication/vldb-2017/vldb2017)
* [studying how developers use automatically generated bug patches](publication/vlhcc-2019/vlhcc2019)
* [using deep learning to improve code search using natural language](publication/fse-2019/fse2019)
* [applying active learning to infer and regenerate software](publication/onward-2019/onward2019)
* developing a risk prediction model for pancreatic cancer using electronic health records (to appear in European Journal of Cancer)


I spent the summer of 2020 as an intern with the SysML team at Facebook
AI Research. Prior to that, I spent the summer of 2018 (as an intern)
and the fall of 2018 (as a part-time research collaborator) with the
Probability team at Facebook.

Before coming to MIT, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at NYU,
where I worked with Dennis Shasha on implementing AQuery, an optimizing
compiler for order-related database queries. Before that, I worked for Morgan Stanley as part of the housing and mortgage research group. I graduated with a B.A. in Economics
from University of Pennsylvania in 2011. I'm originally from San José, Costa Rica.
