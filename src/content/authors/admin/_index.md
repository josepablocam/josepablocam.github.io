I'm a third year Computer Science Ph.D.
student at MIT, advised by Martin Rinard.

Before coming here, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at NYU,
where I worked with Dennis Shasha on implementing AQuery, an optimizing
compiler for order-related database queries. Before that, I worked for Morgan Stanley as part of the
housing and mortgage research group. I graduated with a B.A. in Economics
from University of Pennsylvania in 2011. I'm originally from San José, Costa Rica.

My main research interests center around programming languages,
databases, and data science. I'm particularly interested in applying
programming language techniques to improve the way we do work in the latter
two areas.

These interests include directions such as:

- **optimization**: ***how can we optimize data analysis-related programming tasks and systems?*** I particularly like the idea of optimizations that
  stem from a key insight in the way we use and think about data, rather than
  necessarily focusing on optimization from a systems-perspective. Our
  recent work on [working with missing data](publication/vldb2017/) is one such example.
- **user experience/accessibility**: ***how can we make programming for data analysis easier and accessible to non-experts?*** An increasingly large
  portion of the data-science community have domain expertise in areas
  outside of computer science and programming. I believe we are responsible
  for producing and improving tools that allow them to be productive without
  getting mired in details they may not be interested in.
- **automation**: ***how can we learn useful patterns in programming for data analysis and automate them to produce more robust programs/applications?***
  Many tasks related to data analysis are tedious, repetitive, and error-prone. We should look for opportunities to remove human interaction from these
  and allow experts to focus on the core of their problems.

I've also worked on an assortment of other projects, such
as using iOS data to customize image compression for users with color vision
deficiencies, and performing large-scale color vision analysis across different
countries.
