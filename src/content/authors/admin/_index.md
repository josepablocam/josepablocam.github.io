I'm a senior researcher on the [PROSE team at Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/),
where we develop state-of-the-art program synthesis technologies to make software development
more accessible, productive, and fun. My current line of work focuses on
using neurosymbolic techniques for applications ranging from
program repair to programming by example, with a particular emphasis on the former.

Some of our recent work at PROSE includes:

* [Neurosymbolic low-code formula repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11765) (OOPSLA 2022)
* [Learning Table Formatting Rules By Example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06032) (to appear VLDB 2023)
* [Large language model-based multi-lingual program repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11640) (AAAI 2023)
* [FlashFill++: Scaling Programming by Example by Cutting to the Chase](pdf/popl23-flashfillpp.pdf) (POPL 2023)
* [Generating High-Precision Feedback for Programming Syntax Errors using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04662) (to appear EDM 2023)
* [Repairing Bugs in Python Assignments Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14876)

If you're a PhD student in a related area of research (e.g. SE, PL, ML)
and are interested in doing an internship with me, please reach out
via [email](mailto:jcambronero@microsoft.com) with your CV and quick blurb on 
your interests.

Before joining Microsoft, I received my PhD from MIT, under the supervision
of Martin Rinard. You can find a copy of my thesis [here](pdf/JCambronero-PhD-EECS-June2021.pdf).

I have also researched and published work on:

* [using dynamic program analysis for automated machine learning (AutoML)](publication/oopsla-2019/oopsla2019)
* [generating AutoML search spaces using API docs and code corpora](publication/fse-2020/fse2020)
* [mining nearby transformations of machine learning pipelines to improve their performance](publication/janus/janus)
* [evaluating the empirical impact of downsampling as a way to scale genetic-programming-based AutoML to large datasets](publication/downsampling/downsampling)
* [mining data wrangling functions from collections of Python programs written to work with the same dataset](publication/wranglesearch/wranglesearch)
* [optimizing database queries to perform dynamic imputation](publication/vldb-2017/vldb2017)
* [studying how developers use automatically generated bug patches](publication/vlhcc-2019/vlhcc2019)
* [using deep learning to improve code search using natural language](publication/fse-2019/fse2019)
* [applying active learning to infer and regenerate software](publication/onward-2019/onward2019)
* [developing a risk prediction model for pancreatic cancer using electronic health records](publication/ejc-pdac/pdac)


Before my PhD, I obtained an M.S. in Computer Science (NYU) and a B.A.
in Economics (University of Pennsylvania). I have had the opportunity of working (both as an intern and full-time employee)
across technology and finance companies, in a variety of roles.
I'm originally from San José, Costa Rica.
