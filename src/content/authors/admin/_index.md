I'm a researcher on the [PROSE team at Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/),
where we develop state-of-the-art program synthesis technologies to make software development
more accessible, productive, and fun.

Before joining Microsoft, I received my PhD from MIT, under the supervision
of Martin Rinard.

You can find a copy of my thesis [here](pdf/JCambronero-PhD-EECS-June2021.pdf).
The results of my thesis research also originally appeared in:

* [using dynamic program analysis for automated machine learning (AutoML)](publication/oopsla-2019/oopsla2019)
* [generating AutoML search spaces using API docs and code corpora](publication/fse-2020/fse2020)
* [mining nearby transformations of machine learning pipelines to improve their performance](publication/janus/janus)

Closely relatedly, I have recently worked on:

* [evaluating the empirical impact of downsampling as a way to scale genetic-programming-based AutoML to large datasets](publication/downsampling/downsampling)
* [mining data wrangling functions from collections of Python programs written to work with the same dataset](publication/wranglesearch/wranglesearch)

I have also researched and published work on:

* [optimizing database queries to perform dynamic imputation](publication/vldb-2017/vldb2017)
* [studying how developers use automatically generated bug patches](publication/vlhcc-2019/vlhcc2019)
* [using deep learning to improve code search using natural language](publication/fse-2019/fse2019)
* [applying active learning to infer and regenerate software](publication/onward-2019/onward2019)
* [developing a risk prediction model for pancreatic cancer using electronic health records](publication/ejc-pdac/pdac)


Before my PhD, I obtained an M.S. in Computer Science (NYU) and a B.A.
in Economics (University of Pennsylvania). I have had the opportunity of working (both as an intern and full-time employee)
across technology and finance companies, in a variety of roles.
I'm originally from San José, Costa Rica.
