abstract = "Aim: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is often diagnosed at a late, incurable stage. We sought to determine whether individuals at high risk of developing PDAC could be identified early using routinely collected data. Methods: Electronic health record (EHR) databases from two independent hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, providing inpatient, outpatient, and emergency care, from 1979 through 2017, were used with case-control matching. PDAC cases were selected using International Classification of Diseases 9/10 codes and validated with tumour registries. A data-driven feature selection approach was used to develop neural networks and L2-regularised logistic regression (LR) models on training data (594 cases, 100,787 controls) and compared with a published model based on hand-selected diagnoses (‘baseline’). Model performance was validated on an external database (408 cases, 160,185 controls). Three prediction lead times (180, 270 and 365 days) were considered. Results: The LR model had the best performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-0.76) for the training set, and AUC 0.68 (CI: 0.65-0.71) for the validation set, 365 days before diagnosis. Data-driven feature selection improved results over 'baseline' (AUC 0.55; CI: 0.52-0.58). The LR model flags 2692 (CI 2592-2791) of 156,485 as high risk, 365 days in advance, identifying 25 (CI: 16-36) cancer patients. Risk stratification showed that the high-risk group presented a cancer rate 3 to 5 times the prevalence in our data set. Conclusion: A simple EHR model, based on diagnoses, can identify high-risk individuals for PDAC up to one year in advance. This inexpensive, systematic approach may serve as the first sieve for selection of individuals for PDAC screening programs."
