abstract = "Analysts spend a substantial amount of time wrangling (i.e., preparing) data for their analyses. We present wranglesearch, a system that automatically extracts reusable data wrangling functions from a corpus of existing Python programs written to analyze a particular dataset. A new analyst can query wranglesearch’s function data- base to obtain wrangling functions that they can integrate into their own analyses, leveraging the wrangling efforts of prior analysts."
