abstract = {Spreadsheets are widely used for table manipulation and presentation. Stylistic formatting of these tables is an important property for presentation and analysis. As a result, popular spreadsheet software, such as Excel, supports automatically formatting tables based on rules. Unfortunately, writing such formatting rules can be challenging for users as it requires knowledge of the underlying rule language and data logic. We present Cornet, a system that tackles the novel problem of automatically learning such formatting rules from user-provided formatted cells. Cornet takes inspiration from advances in inductive programming and combines symbolic rule enumeration with a neural ranker to learn conditional formatting rules. To motivate and evaluate our approach, we extracted tables with over 450K unique formatting rules from a corpus of over 1.8M real worksheets. Since we are the first to introduce the task of automatically learning conditional formatting rules, we compare Cornet to a wide range of symbolic and neural baselines adapted from related domains. Our results show that Cornet accurately learns rules across varying setups. Additionally, we show that in some cases Cornet can find rules that are shorter than those written by users and can also discover rules in spreadsheets that users have manually formatted. Furthermore, we present two case studies investigating the generality of our approach by extending Cornet to related data tasks (e.g., filtering) and generalizing to conditional formatting over multiple columns.},

    abstract = {Most programmers make mistakes when writing code. Some of these mistakes are small and require few edits to the original program - a class of errors recently termed last mile mistakes. These errors break the flow for experienced developers and can stump novice programmers. Existing automated repair techniques targeting this class of errors are language-specific and do not easily carry over to new languages. Transferring symbolic approaches requires substantial engineering and neural approaches require data and retraining. We introduce RING, a multilingual repair engine powered by a large language model trained on code (LLMC) such as Codex. Such a multilingual engine enables a flipped model for programming assistance, one where the programmer writes code and the AI assistance suggests fixes, compared to traditional code suggestion technology. Taking inspiration from the way programmers manually fix bugs, we show that a prompt-based strategy that conceptualizes repair as localization, transformation, and candidate ranking, can successfully repair programs in multiple languages with minimal effort. We present the first results for such a multilingual repair engine by evaluating on 6 different languages and comparing performance to language-specific repair engines. We show that RING can outperform language- specific repair engines for three of these languages.},

abstract = {Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing computing education by powering next-generation educational technologies. State-of-the-art models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT&nbsp;[8] and GPT-4&nbsp;[9] could enhance programming education in various roles, e.g., by acting as a personalized digital tutor for a student, a digital assistant for an educator, and a digital peer for collaborative learning&nbsp;[1, 2, 7]. In our work, we seek to comprehensively evaluate and benchmark state-of-the-art large language models for various scenarios in programming education. Recent works have evaluated several large language models in the context of programming education&nbsp;[4, 6, 10, 11, 12]. However, these works are limited for several reasons: they have typically focused on evaluating a specific model for a specific education scenario (e.g., generating explanations), or have considered models that are already outdated (e.g., OpenAI’s Codex&nbsp;[3] is no longer publicly available since March 2023). Consequently, there is a lack of systematic study that benchmarks state-of-the-art models for a comprehensive set of programming education scenarios. In our work, we systematically evaluate two models, ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and compare their performance with human tutors for a variety of scenarios in programming education. These scenarios are designed to capture distinct roles these models could play, namely digital tutors, assistants, and peers, as discussed above. More concretely, we consider the following six scenarios: (1) program repair, i.e., fixing a student’s buggy program; (2) hint generation, i.e., providing a natural language hint to the student to help resolve current issues; (3) grading feedback, i.e., grading a student’s program w.r.t. a given rubric; (4) peer programming, i.e., completing a partially written program or generating a sketch for the solution program; (5) task creation, i.e., generating new tasks that exercise specific types of concepts or bugs; (6) contextualized explanation, i.e., explaining specific concepts or functions in the context of a given program. Our study uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative evaluation to compare the performance of these models with the performance of human tutors. We conduct our evaluation based on 5 introductory Python programming problems with a diverse set of input/output specifications. For each of these problems, we consider 5 buggy programs based on publicly accessible submissions from geeksforgeeks.org &nbsp;[5] (see Figure&nbsp;1); these buggy programs are picked to capture different types of bugs for each problem. We will provide a detailed analysis of the data and results in a longer version of this poster. Our preliminary results show that GPT-4 drastically outperforms ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and comes close to human tutors’ performance for several scenarios.},

Auto-regressive models for code generation from natural language have a similar limitation: they do not easily allow reconsidering earlier tokens generated. We introduce CodeFusion, a pre-trained diffusion code generation model that addresses this limitation by iteratively denoising a complete program conditioned on the encoded natural language. We evaluate CodeFusion on the task of natural language to code generation for Bash, Python, and Microsoft Excel conditional formatting (CF) rules. Experiments show that CodeFusion (75M parameters) performs on par with state-of-the-art auto-regressive systems (350M-175B parameters) in top-1 accuracy and outperforms them in top-3 and top-5 accuracy due to its better balance in diversity versus quality.",

abstract = {Modern email clients support predicate-based folder assignment rules that can automatically organize emails. Unfortunately, users still need to write these rules manually. Prior machine learning approaches have framed automatically assigning email to folders as a classification task and do not produce symbolic rules. Prior inductive logic programming (ILP) approaches, which generate symbolic rules, fail to learn efficiently in the online environment needed for email management. To close this gap, we present EmFORE, an online system that learns symbolic rules for email classification from observations. Our key insights to do this successfully are: (1) learning rules over a folder abstraction that supports quickly determining candidate predicates to add or replace terms in a rule, (2) ensuring that rules remain consistent with historical assignments, (3) ranking rule updates based on existing predicate and folder name similarity, and (4) building a rule suppression model to avoid surfacing low-confidence folder predictions while keeping the rule for future use. We evaluate on two popular public email corpora and compare to 13 baselines, including state-of-the-art folder assignment systems, incremental machine learning, ILP and transformer-based approaches. We find that EmFORE performs significantly better, updates four orders of magnitude faster, and is more robust than existing methods and baselines.},

abstract = {Most users of low-code platforms, such as Excel and PowerApps, write programs in domain-specific formula languages to carry out nontrivial tasks. Often users can write most of the program they want, but introduce small mistakes that yield broken formulas. These mistakes, which can be both syntactic and semantic, are hard for low-code users to identify and fix, even though they can be resolved with just a few edits. We formalize the problem of producing such edits as the last-mile repair problem. To address this problem, we developed LaMirage, a LAst-MIle RepAir-engine GEnerator that combines symbolic and neural techniques to perform last-mile repair in low-code formula languages. LaMirage takes a grammar and a set of domain-specific constraints/rules, which jointly approximate the target language, and uses these to generate a repair engine that can fix formulas in that language. To tackle the challenges of localizing errors and ranking candidate repairs, LaMirage leverages neural techniques, whereas it relies on symbolic methods to generate candidate edits. This combination allows LaMirage to find repairs that satisfy the provided grammar and constraints, and then pick the most natural repair. We compare LaMirage to state-of-the-art neural and symbolic approaches on 400 real Excel and Power Fx formulas, where LaMirage outperforms all baselines. We release these benchmarks to encourage subsequent work in low-code domains.},
