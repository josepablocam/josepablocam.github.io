abstract = "We introduce a new technique for incremental color quantization. The technique provides improved image compression for observers with color vision deficiencies. It is based on a user-specific pseudometric estimated from a large dataset collected by a mobile game that explores color perception. Preliminary results from our implementation of the new color quantization technique show that it achieves average compression improvements of 7%–31% on the outputs of the popular compressors TINYPNG and pngquant, for a set of 24 images from the Kodak benchmark suite. The improvements result from undoing conservative decisions made by TINYPNG and pngquant, which do not customize compression for observers with color vision deficiencies."
