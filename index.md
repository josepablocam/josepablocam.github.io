Hi! My name is Jose Cambronero. I'm currently a student in the NYU
MS in CS program at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

My main interests currently include programming languages (with a strong incline towards functional programming), compiler construction, and natural language processing. For each, you can find some references below to projects or involvement that I have in the various area.

At some point I plan on migrating my wordpress blog over to this site. But for now, feel free to check it out [here](https://symfun.wordpress.com). It touches on various programming concepts etc that I find interesting and want to practice explaining.

### Where in the world is Jose?
I'm currently in CA, interning at Cloudera as part of the data science team.
