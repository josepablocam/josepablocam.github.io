Hi! My name is Jose Cambronero. I'm currently a student in the NYU
MS in CS program at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

My main interests currently include programming languages (with a strong incline towards functional programming), compiler construction, and natural language processing. 

At some point I plan on migrating my wordpress blog over to this site. But for now, feel free to check it out [here](https://symfun.wordpress.com). It touches on various programming concepts etc that I find interesting and want to practice explaining.

### Where in the world is Jose?
I'm back in NYC for my final year of Masters program. I was in CA over the summer working as an
intern as part of the Data Science team at Cloudera. 

For the current semester, my time will be divided between classes (Statistical Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and Principles of Software Security), grading for Dr. Kris and Dr. Eva Rose's [Compiler Construction class](http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall15/CSCI-GA.2130-001/) (a phenomenally interesting class that I encourage all students to take), and further working on my Aquery research project.

I'm always open to interesting opportunities and exploring new fields, so if you think you have something where my skills might line up, definitely feel free to drop me a line.
