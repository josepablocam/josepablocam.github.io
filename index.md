Hi! My name is Jose Cambronero. I recently graduated from the MS in CS program at Courant Institute
of Mathematical Sciences.

My main interests currently include programming languages (with a strong incline towards functional programming), compiler construction, and natural language processing. 

At some point I plan on migrating my wordpress blog over to this site. But for now, feel free to check it out [here](https://symfun.wordpress.com). It touches on various programming concepts etc that I find interesting and want to practice explaining.

### Where in the world is Jose?
I just finished up my MS program :). 

Over the summer I'll be working on a parallel version of AQuery, and a project related to dynamic taint tracking.

I'm excited to say that in the fall I'll be joining the programming languages group at MIT to begin
my PhD studies.

I'm always open to interesting opportunities and exploring new fields, so if you think you have something where my skills might line up, definitely feel free to drop me a line.
