Hi! My name is Jose Cambronero. I'm currently a student in the NYU
MS in CS program.

My main interests currently involved programming languages (with a strong incline towards functional programming), compiler construction, and natural language processing. For each, you kind find some references below to projects or involvement that I have in the area.

At some point I plan on migrating my wordpress blog over to this site. But for now, feel free to check it out [here](https://symfun.wordpress.com)

### Where in the world is Jose?
I'm currently in CA, interning at Cloudera as part of the data science team.
