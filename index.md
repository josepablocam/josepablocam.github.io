Hi! My name is Jose Cambronero. I'm currently a student in the NYU
MS in CS program at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

My main interests currently include programming languages (with a strong incline towards functional programming), compiler construction, and natural language processing. 

At some point I plan on migrating my wordpress blog over to this site. But for now, feel free to check it out [here](https://symfun.wordpress.com). It touches on various programming concepts etc that I find interesting and want to practice explaining.

### Where in the world is Jose?
I'm back in NYC for my final semester of Masters program. Last semester I spent my time
working further on AQuery (under the supervision of Dr. Dennis Shasha), grading for Dr. Kris and
Eva Rose's Compiler Construction class, and taking classes (Statistical NLP, Predictive Analytics, and
Principles of Software Security).

This upcoming semester I will be dividing my time between further AQuery development (hopefully some
solid documentation!), grading for Drs. Rose' Compiler class, and taking a course titled [Rigorous Software Development](http://cs.nyu.edu/wies/teaching/rsd-sp16/). The latter is my attempt to continue exploring the world of program security and
verification, which I was introduced to by Dr. Patrick Cousot's class (Principles of Software Security) and which I
found incredibly interesting.

I'm always open to interesting opportunities and exploring new fields, so if you think you have something where my skills might line up, definitely feel free to drop me a line.
