Before that, I worked for Morgan Stanley as part of the housing and mortgage research group. I graduated with a B.A. in Economics from University of Pennsylvania in 2011. I\u0026rsquo;m originally from San José, Costa Rica.\nMy main research interests center around programming languages, databases, and data science. I\u0026rsquo;m particularly interested in applying programming language techniques to improve the way we do work in the latter two areas.\nThese interests include directions such as:\n optimization: how can we optimize data analysis-related programming tasks and systems? I particularly like the idea of optimizations that stem from a key insight in the way we use and think about data, rather than necessarily focusing on optimization from a systems-perspective. Our recent work on working with missing data is one such example. user experience/accessibility: how can we make programming for data analysis easier and accessible to non-experts? An increasingly large portion of the data-science community have domain expertise in areas outside of computer science and programming. I believe we are responsible for producing and improving tools that allow them to be productive without getting mired in details they may not be interested in. automation: how can we learn useful patterns in programming for data analysis and automate them to produce more robust programs/applications? Many tasks related to data analysis are tedious, repetitive, and error-prone. We should look for opportunities to remove human interaction from these and allow experts to focus on the core of their problems.  I\u0026rsquo;ve also worked on an assortment of other projects, such as using iOS data to customize image compression for users with color vision deficiencies, and performing large-scale color vision analysis across different countries.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"http://josecambronero.com/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m a third year Computer Science Ph.D. student at MIT, advised by Martin Rinard.\nBefore coming here, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at NYU, where I worked with Dennis Shasha on implementing AQuery, an optimizing compiler for order-related database queries.

Common across these proposals is the idea of embedding code and natural language queries, into real vectors and then using vector distance to approximate semantic correlation between code and the query. Multiple approaches exist for learning these embeddings, including unsupervised techniques, which rely only on a corpus of code examples, and supervised techniques, which use an aligned corpus of paired code and natural language descriptions. The goal of this supervision is to produce embeddings that are more similar for a query and the corresponding desired code snippet. Clearly, there are choices in whether to use supervised techniques at all, and if one does, what sort of network and training to use for supervision. This paper is the first to evaluate these choices systematically. To this end, we assembled implementations of state-of-the-art techniques to run on a common platform, training and evaluation corpora. To explore the design space in network complexity, we also introduced a new design point that is a minimal supervision extension to an existing unsupervised technique. Our evaluation shows that: 1. adding supervision to an existing unsupervised technique can improve performance, though not necessarily by much; 2. simple networks for supervision can be more effective that more sophisticated sequence-based networks for code search; 3. while it is common to use docstrings to carry out supervision, there is a sizeable gap between the effectiveness of docstrings and a more query-appropriate supervision corpus.","tags":null,"title":"When Deep Learning Met Code Search","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

Users are forced to pick between removing tuples with missing values or creating a cleaned version of their data by applying a relatively expensive imputation strategy. Our system, ImputeDB, incorporates imputation into a cost- based query optimizer, performing necessary imputations on- the-fly for each query. This allows users to immediately explore their data, while the system picks the optimal placement of imputation operations. We evaluate this approach on three real-world survey-based datasets. Our experiments show that our query plans execute between 10 and 140 times faster than first imputing the base tables. Furthermore, we show that the query results from on-the-fly imputation differ from the traditional base-table imputation approach by 0–20%. Finally, we show that while dropping tuples with missing values that fail query constraints discards 6–78% of the data, on-the-fly imputation loses only 0–21%.","tags":null,"title":"Query Optimization for Dynamic Imputation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1474329600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1474329600,"objectID":"faf4d254646fe9acb9cded331bf09584","permalink":"http://josecambronero.com/talk/kx-meetup-2016/","publishdate":"2016-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/kx-meetup-2016/","section":"talk","summary":"In this talk, Dennis Shasha and I present some of our work on AQuery, an optimizing compiler for order-related queries.
