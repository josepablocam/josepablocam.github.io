I'm a senior researcher on the [PROSE team at Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/),
where we develop state-of-the-art program synthesis technologies to make software development
more accessible, productive, and fun. My current line of work focuses on
using neurosymbolic techniques for applications ranging from
program repair to programming by example, with a particular emphasis on the former.
